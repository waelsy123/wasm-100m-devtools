/**
* The following custom query all implement the same traversal logic and as such
* it would be nice if we could refactor this out instead of repeating ourselves.
* But because the handlers will be stringified and sent over the wire through
* CDP, we need the functions to be completely self-contained and not refer any
* names from the outer scope. This means that such a refactoring can only be
* achieved by using reflection, which we decided against.
