/**
 * There are 8 types of labels.
 *
 * There are 4 positions a label can have on the y axis, relative to the element:
 * - topCorner, bottomCorner: placed inside of the element, in its left corners
 * - aboveElement, belowElement: placed outside of the element, aligned on the
 *   left edge of the element
 *
 * The label position is determined as follows:
 * 1. Top corner if the element is wider and taller than the element
 * 2. Above element if the label is wider or taller than the element
 * 3. Below element if the label would be placed above the element, but this would
 *    cause it to overlap with another label or intersect the top of the window
 * 4. Bottom corner if the label would be placed below the element, but this would
 *    cause it to intersect the bottom of the window
 * On the x axis, the label is always aligned with its element's leftmost edge.
 *
 * The label may need additional styles if it is taller or wider than the element,
 * to make sure all borders that don't touch the element's outline are rounded
 * - Wider: right corners are rounded
 * - Taller: top corners are rounded
 *
 * Examples: (E = element, L = label)
 *             ______
 *            |_L_|  | (the bottom right corner of the label will be rounded)
 * topCorner: |      |
 *            |___E__|
 *                     ___
 *                    |_L_| (the bottom right corner of the label will be rounded)
 * aboveElementWider: | |
 *                    |E|
 *                    |_|
 *                      ______
 * bottomCornerTaller: |  L   |_____
 *                     |______|__E__|
